# Minimum-Viable-Block-Chain
Minimum Viable Block Chain
## Usage
1. Install requirements with pip3
2. run driver.py without parameters
## Results
### Blocks
All blocks will be put into individual files under blocks folder
### Transactions
Transactions will be in transactions.json
## Tests
### Tx
Transactions are generated by tx_con() functions, details are in docstring
### Broadcast
To test broadcasts, instead of join after all started, join after each started.

Seems they will not fork normally since computer too fast, so after 1 node finish, 
it will broadcast all its blocks, the rest will receive those before even started.
## Malicious
Node 3 is always malicious, spiting out wrong pow, others will reject it.
